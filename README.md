Our project, the "Social Media Misinformation Dataset Collection and Management (SMDM)," is a comprehensive solution to the challenges posed by the rampant spread of misinformation across social media platforms. Through meticulous development and ongoing maintenance, we've crafted a specialized database aimed at meticulously tracking and analyzing misinformation in the digital sphere. By employing cutting-edge database technology, we've ensured scalability to handle vast amounts of data efficiently, while also prioritizing data integrity, real-time updates, and robust security measures. In recognizing the limitations of traditional tools like Excel files, our project offers a sophisticated platform for researchers, policymakers, and analysts to delve into the depths of misinformation spread, understand its dynamics, pinpoint key sources, and develop effective countermeasures. With a keen focus on combating misinformation and fostering a more informed society, our team is proud to have completed this crucial endeavor.
